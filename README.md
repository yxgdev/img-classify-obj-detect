Image Classification and Object Detection

Description
This project aims to try out how to perform image classification and object detection using the ImageAI library. It allows you to perform these tasks on images using pre-trained models, making it easy to identify objects in images and classify them into predefined categories.

The project utilizes the RetinaNet model for object detection and ResNet image classification model trained on a specific dataset.

Features
Image classification: Classify images into predefined categories using ResNet.
Object detection: Detect objects in images using the RetinaNet model.

This project can also be done using custom trained model.

Usage
Perform image classification:
